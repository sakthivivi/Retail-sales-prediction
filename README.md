Retail Sales Forecast:

Retail Sales Forecast employs advanced machine learning techniques, prioritizing careful data preprocessing, feature enhancement, and comprehensive algorithm assessment and selection. The streamlined Streamlit application integrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends, patterns, and data insights. It offers users interactive tools to explore top-performing stores and departments, conduct insightful feature comparisons, and obtain personalized sales forecasts. With a commitment to delivering actionable insights, the project aims to optimize decision-making processes within the dynamic retail landscape.

Key Technologies and Skills Installation:

Python, Numpy, Pandas, Plotly Matplotlib, seaborn 

Data Preprocessing:

Data Understanding: The dataset comprises store, sales, and features data, offering details on store attributes like name, department, date, type, size, weekly sales, and environmental factors such as holiday status, temperature, fuel price, multiple markdowns, CPI, and unemployment. The primary focus is on predicting weekly sales, serving as the target variable for our modeling endeavors. This initial exploration forms the basis for subsequent data preprocessing and model development.

Encoding and Data Type Conversion: The process involves preparing categorical features for modeling by transforming them into numerical representations, considering their inherent nature and relationship with the target variable. Simultaneously, data types are converted to align with the modeling process requirements, ensuring seamless integration and compatibility. This step facilitates the effective utilization of categorical information in the subsequent stages of the project.

Handling Null Values: Notably, the 'MarkDown' columns present a challenge with over null values, while other columns exhibit minimal null values. To address this, we employ machine learning models to predict and impute the missing values, ensuring a more complete and robust dataset for subsequent analysis and modeling. This strategic approach allows us to mitigate the impact of missing data on the overall quality of our dataset.

Feature Improvement: Emphasizing enhanced modeling effectiveness, we concentrate on refining the dataset. This involves creating new features to extract deeper insights and enhance overall dataset efficiency. 

Deep Learning Overview:

Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with many layers to automatically learn representations of data through multiple levels of abstraction. It has revolutionized fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition by enabling systems to perform tasks with high accuracy and efficiency.
