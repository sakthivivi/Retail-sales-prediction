# RETAIL-SALES-PREDICTION
Retail Sales Forecast employs advanced machine learning techniques, prioritizing careful data preprocessing, feature enhancement, and comprehensive algorithm assessment and selection. The streamlined Streamlit application integrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends, patterns, and data insights. It offers users interactive tools to explore top-performing stores and departments, conduct insightful feature comparisons, and obtain personalized sales forecasts. With a commitment to delivering actionable insights, the project aims to optimize decision-making processes within the dynamic retail landscape.
Key points:
Machine Learning (ML):
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms to enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.
Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to create new features or modify existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.
Deep Learning (DL):
Deep Learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that focuses on using neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data.
